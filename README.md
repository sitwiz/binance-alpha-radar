# Alpha Radar

Alpha Radar is a Binance Alpha meme coin scanner that prioritizes trust and structure over hype.
It analyzes mint/freeze authority, holder concentration, and best-effort liquidity signals, then writes snapshot + alert-ready JSON.
Built as a portfolio-grade trading intelligence system — not a pump tool.
